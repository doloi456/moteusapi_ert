This directory contains a (unchanged) library from <https://github.com/sinaaghli/moteusapi> with additional files (extensions) so it could be used with <https://github.com/aa4cc/ert_linux>

The **moteusapi_ert** is completely contained in this folder. To use the API, copy this folder to your project. **Note** that before compilation via ERT Simulink, the file **rtwtypes.h** needs to be removed from this folder. The header file is in this folder only for running the examples.

The functions that can be called from the Simulink are listed in the file **MoteusAPI_ERT.h**.
